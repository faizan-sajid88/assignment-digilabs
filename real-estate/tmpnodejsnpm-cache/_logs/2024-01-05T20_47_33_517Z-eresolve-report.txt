# npm resolution error report

While resolving: real-estate@0.1.0
Found: react@18.2.0
node_modules/react
  react@"^18.2.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0" from react-location-picker@1.5.0
node_modules/react-location-picker
  react-location-picker@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
